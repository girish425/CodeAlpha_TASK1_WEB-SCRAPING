This repo contains all my work based on task 1 which involves data scraping and validating data and cleaning data by removing duplicates and storing in it a structured format for future analysis.

# Task 1 – Web Scraping using Python
-------------------------------------

This project demonstrates the use of web scraping techniques to extract data from websites and convert it into a structured dataset for analysis using Python.

📌 Introduction
Web scraping is an automated process of collecting data from websites. In this task, Python was used to scrape publicly available data from a website and store it in a clean, structured format. This task provides hands-on experience in real-world data collection and automation.

🎯 Objective
- Understand the structure of web pages (HTML)
- Extract relevant data from websites using Python
- Create a custom dataset for analysis
- Clean and validate extracted data

 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Requests  
- BeautifulSoup  
- Pandas  

🌐 Website Scraped
- https://books.toscrape.com/

 📊 Dataset Description
- The dataset was created by scraping book-related information from the website
- Extracted data includes book names
- Data was cleaned and stored in Excel (`.xlsx`) format for further analysis

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Process
1. Website Selection 
   Selected a publicly available website for scraping.

2. Understanding HTML Structure  
   Analyzed HTML tags and identified elements containing book names.

3. Fetching Web Page Content 
   Used the 'requests' library to send HTTP requests and retrieve webpage content.

4. Parsing HTML Content 
   Parsed the fetched HTML using 'BeautifulSoup' to navigate the webpage structure.

5. Data Extraction 
   Targeted specific HTML tags to extract relevant information such as book titles.

6. Data Storage 
   Stored the extracted data in Excel format for ease of analysis.

7. Data Cleaning
   Removed duplicates and checked for missing values to ensure data quality.

 ✅ Conclusion
This task provided practical experience in web scraping using Python. It enhanced my understanding of HTML structure, data extraction techniques, data cleaning, and ethical web scraping practices. Overall, this project helped build a strong foundation in real-world data acquisition and preprocessing.
